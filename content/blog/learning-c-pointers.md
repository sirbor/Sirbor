# Learning C: Pointers Demystified

> "To understand pointers is to understand C." â€” Yashavant Kanetkar

## What is a Pointer?
A pointer is a variable that stores the memory address of another variable.

## Example

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int x = 42;
    int *p = &x;
    printf("x = %d, *p = %d\n", x, *p);
    return 0;
}
```

## Why Use Pointers?
- Dynamic memory allocation
- Efficient array and string handling
- Building data structures (linked lists, trees)

## Tips
- Always initialize pointers
- Be careful with pointer arithmetic
