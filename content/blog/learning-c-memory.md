## Dynamic Memory Allocation

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

int main() {
    int *arr = malloc(5 * sizeof(int));
    if (arr == NULL) {
        // Always check for allocation failure!
        return 1;
    }
    for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) arr[i] = i * i;
    for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) printf("%d ", arr[i]);
    free(arr);
    return 0;
}
```

## Key Points
- Use `malloc`, `calloc`, `realloc` for dynamic memory
- Always `free` what you allocate
- Avoid memory leaks and dangling pointers
